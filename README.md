## Histrian | Digital humanist | Data scientist

After graduating in History (2018), I began my computer science adventure with a one year [advanced MSc in Digital Humanities](https://set.kuleuven.be/onderwijs/mdh) at KU Leuven. I learned many new skills from programming languages (Python, R, JS, HTML, CSS, SQL) to IT management and UX Design (among many others).
I have been able to apply aspects of my training to my research in medieval history. Using computational linguistics methods, I conduct [stylometric analyses (authorship verification) on a corpus of Latin texts from the late Middle Ages](https://doi.org/10.4000/cem.19285).

## The role of programming historians in companies

Wondering why you should hire a programmer with a background in history and what impact it could have on your company?

Many people see a degree in history as a hindrance to success in the tech industry, but I strongly believe that it is quite the opposite.

First, the skills you acquire as a history student are highly transferable. You learn critical thinking, research and analytical skills, as well as the ability to communicate complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. These skills give historians the ability to solve problems and communicate effectively.

In addition to these transferable skills, the beauty of the tech industry is that you can learn to code and develop your technical abilities. The demand for coders is at an all-time high, and with a background in history, you bring a unique perspective to the table. History teaches you about the context and evolution of societies and the role technology has played in shaping our world. This knowledge can help inform your approach to developing technology and ensure that it is developed in a way that is ethical and responsible.

Furthermore, the industry is in dire need of diversity in perspectives, and a background in history can provide just that. Your understanding of the past can help shape a better future, as you bring a new way of thinking and problem-solving to the table.

With the right training and support, a historian can develop the technical abilities necessary to thrive in the field, while leveraging transferable skills to bring a fresh and unique perspective. A degree in history should be perceived as an asset in the tech industry, not a hindrance.

Let's work together to make a positive impact!
