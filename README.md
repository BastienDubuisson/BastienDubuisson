**Histrian | Digital humanist | Data scientist**

After graduating in History (2018), I began my computer science adventure with a one year [advanced MSc in Digital Humanities](https://set.kuleuven.be/onderwijs/mdh) at KU Leuven. I learned many new skills from programming languages (Python, R, JS, HTML, CSS, SQL) to IT management and UX Design (among many others).
I have been able to apply aspects of my training to my research in medieval history. Using computational linguistics methods, I conduct [stylometric analyses (authorship verification) on a corpus of Latin texts from the late Middle Ages](https://doi.org/10.4000/cem.19285).
